# Game Introduction

## Name

- Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Rules

- In this game, the player plays against the computer.
- Player will choose from 3 buttons with picture of 3 hand signals: "rock", "paper" or "scissors"; and computer will randomly generate a hand signal in response.
- Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper. If both player and computer chooses the same hand signal, it is considered a tie.
- Player and computer both have 3 lives or hearts. If one of them loses in a round, a heart will be lost. Both play until one of them loses all three hearts. The one that is last to lose 3 hearts is the winner.

## Challenges

- Took me some time to figure out how to make only the current chosen hand signal to appear and the previous signals hidden.
- I took a long time researching and trying different codes to make the computer hand signals image loop animation to work. And after I successfully make the animation work, I had a hard time trying to make it stop when player choice is made, so that the computer choice can be shown.

## Technology in use

- HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript

## Future note to self

- Make the buttons non-clickable after the first play through.
- Add an alert box/ popup window to tell player to play the next move
- Add new rules: combo kills (if two consecutive wins = more attack/lose more heart for opponent)
